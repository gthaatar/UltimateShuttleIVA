ULTIMATESHUTTLEIVA - Full Retro

This is the initial testing version of Full Retro. As should have been stated already, we need to look at prop placement and functionality, efficiency of prop placement for gameplay purposes, and to see where and what other improvements can be made to the design.

Requirements:

KSP 1.4.2  - I designed in 1.4.2, but it will likely work in earlier versions depending on MAS, as the latest release for that and what ksp version it is for would define the required version.

Currently the only good looking seats I could find that were also compact enough to allow for the numerous seats in the cockpit)

Required for full functionality in IVA:

MechJEB
Kerbal Alarm Clock
Chatterer

Installation:

Presuming you have the requirements in place, drag and drop UltimateShuttleIVA into your Gamedata.  The MM Patch within will set up the internal for the Mk3 Cockpit, and set its crew capacity to 6.

This is probably where I put a bunch of legal and credit crap. I'm not worried about it right now.
